    Travel
    Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus
    infections, may result in a temporary deferral.

    Many countries also implemented the policy to defer blood donors with a history of travel or
    residence for defined cumulative exposure periods in specified countries or areas, as a measure
    to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by blood
    transfusion.

    Behaviours
    You must not give blood:

    If you engaged in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12 months
    Individuals with behaviours below will be deferred permanently:
    Have ever had a positive test for HIV (AIDS virus)
    Have ever injected recreational drugs.
    In the national blood donor selection guidelines, there are more behavior eligibility criteria.
    Criteria could be different in different countries.

    Pregnancy and breastfeeding
    Following pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many months as the duration of the
    pregnancy.

    It is not advisable to donate blood while breast-feeding. Following childbirth, the deferral
    period is at least 9 months (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after your baby is
    significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of his/her nutrition from solids or bottle feeding).

    More information on eligibility to donate
    National eligibility guidelines must be followed when people donate blood in the blood service
    in specific countries. To find out whether any health conditions, medications, professions or
    travel history to could affect your ability to give blood, please search for detailed
    information in the national/local blood services.
