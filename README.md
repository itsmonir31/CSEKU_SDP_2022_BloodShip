This software will be made for the use of the students of Khulna University. There are several cases when any of us need blood but we didnâ€™t find the blood. This software will help them in this regard. To know more read the SRS.

Details Description:
Blood donation is crucial in situations like accidents, organ transplants, and cancer treatments. Additionally, individuals interested in donating blood should either attend a designated blood donation event or visit a blood bank. In this context, we introduce our blood donation management system.

Our system is designed to comprehensively track activities related to blood donation. Initially, it collects and stores data about potential donors in a dedicated database. This database houses all pertinent information regarding blood donation, including health assessments, availability for donation, donation history, and relevant timestamps. This online blood donation management system serves the dual purpose of maintaining a registry of blood donors and aiding recipients in efficiently identifying and contacting suitable donors. It operates through two distinct modules: one for administrators and one for regular users. Users have the capability to register, make donation requests, and also register as potential donors.

This system empowers users to initiate blood donation requests by providing specific details related to their requirements. It employs an automated algorithm to identify and propose suitable donors to the requester. Additionally, users can access a list of donors within their vicinity, ensuring compatibility through blood cross-matching. The system also facilitates checking for existing blood donation requests. In emergency situations, a requester can promptly notify potential blood donors based on their specific needs.

Furthermore, our platform enables direct communication between seekers and donors, facilitating discussions related to the donation process. In cases of urgency, the system sends notifications to potential donors, who can choose to accept or decline the request.

In summary, this project's primary objective is to enhance the management of blood donation information, offering an efficient and organized system for individuals seeking blood donors and for those willing to contribute.
